This repository contains the code to reproduce the results of figure 2 in
<https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05066>. The spatial discretization is implemented in `src/FlouCommon/`
and `src/FlouSpatial/`, and the results can be recovered by following the instructions in the
`flou_tests/` folder of the main [repository](https://github.com/Andres-MG/2023_subcell_Gauss)
of the article.
