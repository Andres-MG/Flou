[![Docs-stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-dev-blue?style=flat-square)](https://andres-mg.github.io/Flou.jl/dev/)

Flou is a (very incomplete) framework to solve partial differential equations. It currently
implements solvers for hyperbolic equations using a high-order flux-reconstruction approach,
supporting only the *Discontinuous Galerkin Spectral Element Method* (DGSEM) reconstruction
functions.
